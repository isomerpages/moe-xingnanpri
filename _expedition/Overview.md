### Expedition

During the six years in Xingnan, every pupil will go through an exciting learning expedition with their peers and teachers. Pupils get to learn subjects in different contexts, acquire technological skills and sharpen 21st Century Competencies to withstand the VUCA world. They achieve success in various aspects of school life, exemplify humility when they are featured as models in the community. Pupils experience commemorative events as a community and readily share their expedition through various forms of expression. The right habits formed at a young age lead our pupils to enjoy their learning expedition for life.
