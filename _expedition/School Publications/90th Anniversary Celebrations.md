### 90th Anniversary Celebrations

Over many decades, Xingnan Primary School has created a long-lasting impact to our staff and our pupils. Reaching out to staff, former staff, pupils and the alumni, we curated 90 Stories, 90 Memories. Let us take you through some of the most memorable experiences Xingnanians have had.
