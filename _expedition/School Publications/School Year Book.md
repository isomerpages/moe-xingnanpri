the past year, we invite you to embark on a journey through the pages of
our meticulously crafted yearbook.</p>

the 2023 yearbook is protected with a password. The password can be retrieved
from the respective form teachers of our students. Simply reach out to
your child's form teacher, who will provide you with the password to access
the digital version of the yearbook. We kindly request that the password
