<img src="/images/enc1.png" style="width:283px;height:340px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> Dear Parents / Guardians,

We are proud to share with you a book written by a group of 4 nine-year-old students as part of their submission for their Inter-disciplinary Project Work to promote Singapore Botanic Gardens.

  While the events and characters in this story are fictitious, these writers have tapped on their

learning experiences at Singapore Botanic Gardens and worked together to bring you “Amazing Encounters”.


The illustrations showcased in this book was done by an eleven-year-old student under the guidance of his mother.
