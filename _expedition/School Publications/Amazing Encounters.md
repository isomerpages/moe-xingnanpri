## Amazing Encounters

<img src="/images/enc1.png" style="width:283px;height:340px;margin-right:15px;" align="left"> Dear Parents / Guardians,

We are proud to share with you a book written&nbsp;by a group of 4 nine-year-old students as part of their submission&nbsp;for their Inter-disciplinary Project Work to promote Singapore Botanic Gardens.

&nbsp;&nbsp;While&nbsp;the events and characters in this story are fictitious, these writers have tapped on their

learning experiences at Singapore Botanic Gardens and worked together to bring you&nbsp;“Amazing Encounters”.


The illustrations showcased in this book was done by an&nbsp;eleven-year-old student&nbsp;under the guidance of his mother.
