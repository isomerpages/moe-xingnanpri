### 90th Anniversary Celebrations (2021-2022)

<p><a href="https://xingnan90th.wixsite.com/home"><img style="width:55%" src="/images/anni1.png"></a></p>

2022 marks our school's 90th anniversary. In celebration of this momentous milestone, we welcomed our community to reflect on some of our remarkable achievements of the past and present, while embracing the future. Anchoring on a blended approach,<img src="/images/Events/logo.png" style="width:150px;height:150px;margin-left:50px;" align = "left"> we commenced the celebration with a hybrid launch on the eve of Children’s Day. Mr Ang Wei Neng, Member of Parliament (MP) for West Coast GRC (Nanyang), was invited as the Guest-of-Honour to grace the occasion, along with our school leaders and SAC members. Besides the launch of our school anniversary, the occasion saw the unveiling of the 90th anniversary logo designed by Matthew Thji from P6D, and "Our Jurong", a book illustrated by Janice Wong from P5E.

The launch kick-started a year-long school project involving pupils, staff and stakeholders. <img src="/images/Events/90th3.png" style="width:300px;height:200px;margin-left:50px;" align = "right">The project encouraged us to contribute face masks which were distributed to the communities beyond our shores and benefited the less privileged. These masks were deposited into the globe pictured on the top. It was located proudly in the school foyer, reminding us to spare a thought for those who need more care and love.
