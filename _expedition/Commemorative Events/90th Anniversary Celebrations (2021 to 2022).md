### 90th Anniversary Celebrations (2021-2022)

Over many decades, Xingnan Primary School has created a long-lasting impact to our staff and our pupils. Reaching out to staff, former staff, pupils and the alumni, we curated 90 Stories, 90 Memories. Let us take you through some of the most memorable experiences Xingnanians have had.

The launch kick-started a year-long school project involving pupils, staff and stakeholders. The project encourages us to contribute face masks which will be distributed to the communities beyond our shores and benefit the less privileged. These masks are deposited into the globe pictured on the top. It is standing proudly in the school foyer, reminding us to spare a thought for those who need more care and love. As we move closer to our school’s 90th anniversary finale, we can look forward to more celebratory activities along the way leading to the milestone.
