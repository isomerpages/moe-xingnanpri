### 85th Anniversary Celebrations

This year, the school celebrates a key milestone of 85 years in educating generations of pupils. From our humble beginning of 10 pupils in the premises of a temple along Upper Jurong Road, we have developed into a well-equipped and modern school of 1400 pupils. Today, we deliver a variety of meaningful learning experiences that support our pupils’ growth, interests and learning needs as we continue in our mission to nurture minds and build character.

The theme – “Celebrating with a Heart” – reflects our acknowledgement of the community’s support and partnership over the years. As we celebrate our anniversary, everyone – pupils, staff and stakeholders – is encouraged to ‘give back’ to the community in meaningful ways. Several initiatives have been implemented since the launch of our anniversary celebrations in September 2016 and more will be completed this year. 

There are 3 platforms for our celebrations:

##### 85 Kind Acts

The entire school comprising of school staff, pupils, parents, alumni and stakeholders contributes time and resources to carry out 85 kind acts that engage the community and benefit the less privileged. To date, the school has accomplished many kind acts with varying degrees of impact. A photographic summary of completed kind acts is displayed at the school foyer to affirm everyone’s efforts. (Click [here](https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/85kindacts/home) for more details of the kind acts.)

##### Tree of Stars

This fund-raising supports programmes for residents of two nursing homes, NTUC Health Nursing Home and St. Joseph’s Home. A target is set as $31 025, a symbolic figure for the occasion. It is the total derived from a dollar a day for 85 years of collaboration between the community and the school. 

  

For every dollar contributed, a strip of coloured paper is provided to be folded into a paper star. The contributor will then drop it into bottles suspended from an art installation named the “Tree of Stars”. It stands proudly in the school foyer, reminding all to spare a thought for those in the community who need care and love.
