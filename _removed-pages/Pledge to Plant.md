### Pledge to Plant

As Xingnan Primary School prepares to celebrate its 90th Anniversary in 2022, The Ecostewardship committee, Alumni, and the 90th-anniversary team are organizing the "Pledge to Plant" initiative that aims to inspire Xingnanians with opportunities to be responsible individuals and advocates of the environment, and also in line with the Singapore Green Plan 2030 â€” a whole-of-nation movement. We would also like to take the opportunity to organize this with our alumni and involve our students, staff, and stakeholders in this meaningful activity.
