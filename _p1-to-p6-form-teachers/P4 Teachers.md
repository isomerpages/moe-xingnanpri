Primary 4E

_"Stay humble and be eager to learn! A cup cannot take in anymore water if it is full of water itself. If a student is full of himself, he will not be able to gain any new knowledge. A person who is humble will attract many people, who are willing to impart new knowledge to him. As a teacher and also a livelong learner, I feel that these two qualities are the most important to guide our learning self."_

Primary 4E

_"I believe education is not only about teaching the ABCs or the 123s. Rather, it is using subject content to direct children to lifelong learning and character building. Imbibing children with skills and values will prime them for any and every challenge which life throws at them. My hope is for my students to not only be excellent in their academic endeavours, but to also become people of character with a love for others._ Direct children onto the right path. When they are older, they will not depart from it.”
