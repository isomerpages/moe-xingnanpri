<p>I believe that each child is unique in their own way. Aa a teacher, I
hope to touch each of their hearts open their minds through experiential
learning, perspective-taking simulating themconceptually so that they can
grow emotionally, mentally, socially in a healthy manner.</p>

<p>“If you have the choice between being right and being kind, choose being
kind.” - Dr. Wayne W. Dyer</p>
<p>In the pursuit of competence and excellence, it is important to always
be kind. This starts within the classroom, that transcends to their everyday
lives.</p>

<p>Teaching and learning is a journey with routes and traffic lights – We
are guided along the way, we pause to think, stop to reflect and move on
again.</p>

<p>Teaching is not hard work, it's Heart Work. I teach like how I would like
to be taught. Putting myself in the shoes of my students allows me to come
up with engaging and inspiring lessons.</p>
