始终贯彻坚守教岗的信念。我坚信以诚关爱、用心感化，必能牵引学子之心，内化品学，春风化雨。以感恩之心，引领、启发快乐的小天使成为未来闪亮的星星。

**Mr Muhammed Faizal Bin Rawi** <br>
[**muhammed_faizal_rawi@schools.gov.sg**](mailto:muhammed_faizal_rawi@schools.gov.sg)

Our students and our children are our future. I firmly believe that as primary school teachers, it is our duty to gift them the seeds of knowledge, a passion for self-directed learning and to nurture them with the correct social values as they embark on their journey of lifelong education. It takes a village to raise a child and with the help from parents and the school community, I believe that Xingnanians will thrive in this supportive and caring school.

Primary 4C
**Miss Ong Lijing** <br>
[**ong_lijing@schools.gov.sg**](mailto:ong_lijing@schools.gov.sg)

Every child can learn and we can learn together, helping one another to improve continually.

I believe in nurturing, inspiring and motivating each child with tender care and sincerity.

Primary 4D

**Miss Denise Yap** <br>
[**denise_yap@schools.gov.sg**](mailto:denise_yap@schools.gov.sg)

I believe in developing positive relationship with my students. As pupils spend most of their waking time in school, a strong pupil-teacher relationship will lead to better engagement, allowing effective instructions to take place.

**Ms Noriayati Ishak** <br>

Often we find that the students we want to inspire are the ones who end up inspiring us.
