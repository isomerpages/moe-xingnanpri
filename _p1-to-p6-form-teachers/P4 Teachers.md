Primary 4B

Our students and our children are our future. I firmly believe that as primary school teachers, it is our duty to gift them with the seeds of knowledge, a passion for self-directed learning and to nurture them with the correct social values as they embark on their journey of lifelong education. It takes a village to raise a child and with the help from parents and the school community, I believe that Xingnanians will thrive in this supportive and caring school.

I believe in developing positive relationship with my students. As pupils spend most of their waking time in school, a strong pupil-teacher relationship will lead to better engagement, allowing effective instructions to take place.
