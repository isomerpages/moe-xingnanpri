Primary 6A

I believe that every child is like coal. By applying pressure, they can become diamonds.

**Mr Zhong Mingqing** <br>

没有不好的孩子，只有不幸的孩子。用心与孩子交流，以身作则，将他们引上自强不息之路。

Primary 6B

**Mrs Kwek Ai Ling** <br>
[**chau_ai_ling@schools.gov.sg**](mailto:chau_ai_ling@schools.gov.sg)

I believe every child can learn and succeed regardless of their starting point and the time needed.

用真情教书，以诚心育人。

Primary 6C

**Mdm Hazlyna Bte Usope** <br>
[**hazlyna_usope@schools.gov.sg**](mailto:hazlyna_usope@schools.gov.sg )

Teaching is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire. We owe these children the chance to be cared for and to be encouraged to be the best they can be.

Primary 6C

**Mdm Yang Nian** <br>
[**yang_nian@schools.gov.sg**](mailto:yang_nian@schools.gov.sg)

学生都是一颗花的种子，有的一开始就会灿烂地绽放，有的则需要漫长的等待。因此，陪伴学生们一起成长，要有耐心，更要有爱心。

Primary 6D

**Mrs Janet See** <br>
[**chong_yen_lian_janet@schools.gov.sg**](mailto:chong_yen_lian_janet@schools.gov.sg)

I believe that pupils learn best in a non-threatening environment where they are not afraid to make mistakes from which they will learn and become wiser.

Primary 6D

**Mr Balhetchet Daniel Benjamin** <br>
[**daniel_balhetchet@schools.gov.sg**](mailto:daniel_balhetchet@schools.gov.sg)

Learning how to get there is often more important than the outcome. Through failures then we can learn how to pick ourselves up and think differently to solve problems. I believe in equipping the child with a positive mindset to embrace the challenges that lie ahead of them.

Primary 6E

**Mr Benjamin Wong Chun Chit** <br>
[**wong_chun_chit_benjamin@schools.gov.sg**](mailto:wong_chun_chit_benjamin@schools.gov.sg)

I believe that every child has the ability to improve. What matters is, no matter how minute, the child who had performed better today than yesterday is going to do even better tomorrow.

**Miss Gabrielle Ong Suan Woon** <br>
[**ong_suan_woon_gabrielle@schools.gov.sg**](mailto:ong_suan_woon_gabrielle@schools.gov.sg)

I believe education is not only about teaching the ABCs or the 123s. Rather, it is using subject content to direct children to lifelong learning and character building. Imbibing children with skills and values will prime them for any and every challenge which life throws at them. My hope is for my students to not only be excellent in their academic endeavours, but to also become people of character with a love for others.

Direct children onto the right path. When they are older, they will not depart from it.
