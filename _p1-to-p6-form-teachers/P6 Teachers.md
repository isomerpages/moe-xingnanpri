I saw tomorrow marching by on little children's feet. Within their forms and faces read her prophecy complete, I saw tomorrow look at me, from little children's eyes. And I thought how carefully we'd teach if we were truly wise.

My aim is to bring positivity and high expectations to the pupils in my class. I believe that a good attitude will bring students to a higher altitude in their aspirations. My role is to help them discover their strengths and guide them so that they strive to be better today than yesterday. Communication with parents is the key to a wholesome support for the pupils in my class.
