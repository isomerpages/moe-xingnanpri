Primary 3E

_"Stay humble and be eager to learn! A cup cannot take in anymore water if it is full of water itself. If a student is full of himself, he will not be able to gain any new knowledge. A person who is humble will attract many people, who are willing to impart new knowledge to him. As a teacher and also a livelong learner, I feel that these two qualities are the most important to guide our learning self."_
