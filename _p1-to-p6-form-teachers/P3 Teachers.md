Primary 3E

Stay humble and be eager to learn! A cup cannot take in anymore water if it is full of water itself. If a student is full of himself, he will not be able to gain any new knowledge. A person who is humble will attract many people, who are willing to impart new knowledge to him. As a teacher and also a livelong learner, I feel that these two qualities are the most important to guide our learning self.

All children are unique and must have a stimulating educational environment where they can grow mentally, emotionally, and socially. It is my desire to create this type of atmosphere where students can meet their full potential.

Teaching and learning is a journey with routes and traffic lights – We are guided along the way, we pause to think, stop to reflect and move on again.
