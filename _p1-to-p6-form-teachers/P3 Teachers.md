Primary 3A

The best kind of teacher is one who commands respect and love from her students - and in that way students will naturally want to learn from that teacher.

**Mr Muhammed Faizal Bin Rawi** <br>

Our students and our children are our future. I firmly believe that as primary school teachers, it is our duty to gift them the seeds of knowledge, a passion for self-directed learning and to nurture them with the correct social values as they embark on their journey of lifelong education. It takes a village to raise a child and with the help from parents and the school community, I believe that Xingnanians will thrive in this supportive and caring school.
