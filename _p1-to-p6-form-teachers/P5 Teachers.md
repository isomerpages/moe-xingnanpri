<p>My aim is to bring positivity and high expectations to the pupils in my
class. I believe that a good attitude will bring students to a higher altitude
in their aspirations. My role is to help them discover their strengths
and guide them so that they strive to be better today than yesterday. Communication
with parents is the key to a wholesome support for the pupils in my class.</p>

and reach that potential.</p>

and faces read her prophecy complete. I saw tomorrow look at me from little
children's eyes. And I thought how carefully we'd teach if we were truly
wise.</p>
