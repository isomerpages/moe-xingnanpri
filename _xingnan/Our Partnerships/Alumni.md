<img src="/images/xhc2.png" style="width:180px;height:130px;margin-right:15px;" align = "left"> Hello! Are you part of Xingnan Primary School’s community? A former student and/ or staff?  

  

Together with My Community, we are co-creating Xingnan Heritage Centre and we would love to hear from you. Xingnan Primary School and My Community are working together to co-create a heritage centre and we are excited to involve all who are part of the Xingnan community in this meaningful project. Using a participatory design process, we aim to co-design and co-create this Heritage Centre at Xingnan Primary School which will serve as a depository and exhibition of the school's and her community’s rich history, heritage and collective experiences.

  

We hope you can share with us your stories and artefacts that are still etched in your mind before 5 Dec at this link, [https://tinyurl.com/XNShareDonate21.](https://tinyurl.com/XNShareDonate21.)
