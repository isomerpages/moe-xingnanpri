<h3>Xingnan Primary School</h3>
<p>Xingnan Primary School is a school which has stood the test of time. Established

<h4>School Crest</h4>

<p>The school crest was designed by Miss Peng Huijun, a former student, in
1988. The crest was designed to link Xingnan’s past with the future.The
four red petals symbolize the four official languages taught in the school.
The torch is the symbol of the old school. It signifies knowledge and enlightenment.
The diamond outline which resembles a mortar board kindles in the young
mind the thought of tertiary education. In 2006, to reflect the change
in the primary education system from an 8 year course to a 6 year course,
the crest was redesigned to include 6 bands, each indicating a year of
study in primary school. &nbsp;The phrase “Established 1932” was also included
to remind all Xingnanians of our history and how far we have come.</p>
