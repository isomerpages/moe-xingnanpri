### Our Principal's Message

Dear Parents / Guardians, 

At Xingnan Primary School, we seek to provide a vibrant environment that nurtures minds and builds character. Our vision is for every Xingnanian to be ‘A Self-Directed Learner, A Gracious Citizen’. Together with this mission and vision, we hope every Xinganian will be well-anchored in our core values of creativity, loyalty, empathy, respect and responsibility.

 We believe that all children are curious, active and competent learners. They can learn almost anything with the right support and environment. Our focus as educators is to curate quality learning experiences for our children. Even as we strive for academic excellence, we want our Xingnanians to have fun and enjoy their learning.

Throughout their 6 years at Xingnan, our pupils will experience our distinct school-based X3 Learning Years Programme (X3 LYP). X3 stands for the acronyms XCITE, XPLORE and XTEND. The X3 LYP is an approach to learning in 2-year blocks, focusing on providing opportunities for holistic development and lifelong learning.

Our school celebrates our 90th Anniversary in 2022. The theme of our 90th Anniversary is “Appreciate the Past, Celebrate the Present, Embrace the Future. (A.C.E).” To mark this joyous occasion, we have planned a series of meaningful projects and activities.

 We invite you to join us in our many exciting projects and activities in the months to come. Let us all continue to have that strong sense of wonder and curiosity of children as we embrace the future with enthusiasm and hope.

 We are proud of our rich tradition and many achievements over the years. These achievements have been possible through the hard work and dedication of our teachers and staff.  We are grateful for the strong support given by our stakeholders and partners especially our School Advisory Committee, Alumni, Parent Support Group, parents and families for their commitment and dedication to the school.
