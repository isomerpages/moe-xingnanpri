<h3>Our Principal's Message</h3><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:230px;height:300px;margin-left:15px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/Our%20Staff/01%20SL/SL1.png"></div><p>Welcome to Xingnan Primary School, where we believe that "every child is of worth and can learn." Here, we celebrate the uniqueness of each student, acknowledging their individual strengths and interests. Our school values and actively seeks to nurture the diverse talents that make every Xingnanian unique. By fostering an inclusive and supportive environment, we aim to empower every child to reach their full potential.</p><p>The primary school years are a crucial phase in a child's educational journey. In today's rapidly changing and unpredictable VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) world, our commitment goes beyond merely imparting strong literacy and numeracy skills. At Xingnan, we recognise the importance of nurturing the right values and foundational skills, including social-emotional and 21st-century competencies, to ensure our Xingnanians are not just academically proficient but also future-ready individuals.</p><p>In 2023, Xingnan embarked on an extensive review and envisioning exercise to better align our focus and approaches with the changing needs of our students and educational landscape. This strategic initiative, which continues into 2024 reflects our commitment to continuous improvement to provide a forward-looking education that not only is relevant in todayâ€™s context but also prepares our Xingnanians to thrive in the next 50 years.&nbsp;</p><p>To realise our vision of <strong>Confident Person, Self-directed Learner, and Compassionate Leader</strong>, we are on a mission to <strong>provide meaningful experiences that nurture minds and build character</strong>. We believe in creating a holistic learning environment that goes beyond textbooks and examinations, instilling in our students a passion for lifelong learning and a strong sense of student agency, moral and civic responsibility.</p><p>As a school, Xingnan has stood the test of time and grown from strength to strength over the past 91 years, from a little village school to a vibrant one with a conducive learning environment, caring and committed staff and a forward-looking curriculum.&nbsp;It takes a village to raise a child. We appreciate the strong support from our School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group, parents, Alumni, and community partners who have walked the journey with us to develop our students holistically.</p><p>As we embark on a new academic year, let us continue to work hand in hand to create a nurturing and empowering environment for our Xingnanians. Together, we will shape the future leaders and contributors to society and keep our Xingnan torch ablaze in the coming years!</p><p></p><p>Warm regards,</p><p>Mrs Cindy Ong</p><p>Principal and alumnus of Xingnan Primary School</p><h4></h4><p></p>
