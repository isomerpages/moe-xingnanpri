    Welcome to Xingnan Primary School, where we believe that "<strong>every child is of worth and can learn</strong>."
    Here, we celebrate the uniqueness of every Xingnanian, acknowledging their individual strengths and interests. 
    Our school values and actively seeks to nurture the diverse talents that make every Xingnanian unique. By fostering 
    an inclusive and supportive environment, we aim to empower every Xingnanian to reach their full potential.
</p>

<p>
    The primary school years are a crucial phase in a child's educational journey. In today's rapidly changing and 
    unpredictable VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous) world, our commitment goes beyond merely imparting 
    strong literacy and numeracy skills. At Xingnan, we recognise the importance of nurturing the right values and foundational 
    skills, including social-emotional and 21st-century competencies (21CC), to ensure our Xingnanians are not just academically 
    proficient but also future-ready individuals.
</p>

<p>
    To realise our vision of <strong>Confident Person, Self-directed Learner, and Compassionate Leader</strong>, we are on a 
    mission to <strong>provide meaningful experiences that nurture minds and build character</strong>. We believe in creating a 
    holistic learning environment that goes beyond textbooks and examinations, instilling in our students a passion for lifelong 
    learning and a strong sense of student agency, moral and civic responsibility.

    <img style="float: left; width: 35%; margin-left: 15px;" alt="IXORA Framework" src="/images/Our%20Staff/01%20SL/IXORA.png">
    In 2024, we introduced the <strong>IXORA</strong> framework to guide our school in our eco-stewardship efforts. The 4 petals spell 
    out the 4 key thrusts - Curriculum, Culture, Campus and Community - and the strategies for <strong>I</strong>nspiring <strong>X</strong>ingnanians 
    with <strong>O</strong>pportunities to be <strong>R</strong>esponsible Individuals and <strong>A</strong>dvocates of Sustainable Living.
</p>

<p>
    The <strong>IXORA Curriculum</strong>, delivered through our revamped Applied Learning Programme, aims to provide Xingnanians 
    with experiential, authentic, exploratory and interdisciplinary learning experiences to develop their emerging 21CC. Through 
    our 3A approach - <strong>A</strong>wareness, <strong>A</strong>pplication and <strong>A</strong>dvocacy, Xingnanians deepen their awareness 
    of sustainability issues through learning journeys, games and discussions, apply their knowledge and skills from the various 
    subject disciplines to tackle sustainability issues and become agents of change to support sustainable living.
</p>

<p>
    As a school, Xingnan has stood the test of time and grown from strength to strength over the past 92 years, from a little 
    village school to one with a conducive learning environment, caring and committed staff and a forward-looking curriculum. 
    It takes a village to raise a child. We appreciate the strong support from our school advisory committee, parent support 
    group, parents, alumni, and community partners who have walked the journey with us to develop our students holistically.
</p>

<p>
    As we embark on a new academic year, let us continue to work hand in hand to create a nurturing and empowering environment 
    for our Xingnanians. Together, we will shape the future leaders and contributors to society and keep our Xingnan torch 
    ablaze in the coming years!
</p>

Warm regards,<br>
Mrs Cindy Ong <br>
Principal and alumna of Xingnan Primary School
