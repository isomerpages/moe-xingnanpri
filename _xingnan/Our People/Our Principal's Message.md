Dear Parents / Guardians, 

The primary school years are an important phase of a child’s education. As an alumnus of Xingnan Primary, I am grateful to my former teachers for inspiring me to work hard towards my dream to become an educator. They have helped me to develop my self-confidence, the right values and the zeal to learn in my formative years. Today, my heart is filled with immense gratitude to be given the opportunity to pay it forward by returning to my alma mater to serve as Principal with effect from 15 December 2022. 

  

In Xingnan, we believe that _every child is of worth and can learn_. We recognise that our students are unique individuals with their own strengths and interests which our school values and seeks to nurture. Our vision is to develop every Xingnanian to become _a self-directed learner and a gracious citizen._ Thus, we are committed to provide _a vibrant environment that nurtures minds and builds character_.  We seek to provide quality learning experiences to help our Xingnanians discover the joy of learning, explore and pursue their interests and passion and develop the right values, dispositions and competencies. They will then be able to play an active role in shaping the world where they can contribute and thrive in the future.   

  

As a school, Xingnan has stood the test of time and grown from strength to strength over the past 90 years, from a little village school to a vibrant one with a conducive learning environment, caring and committed staff and a forward-looking curriculum. _It takes a village to raise a child_. We appreciate the strong support from our School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group, parents, Alumni and community partners who have walked the journey with us to develop our students holistically. I look forward to forging stronger and meaningful partnerships with you, our stakeholders, to keep our Xingnan torch ablaze in the coming years.
 

Mrs Cindy Ong
