Special Educational Needs Officer<br>

_"I believe that as teachers it is our responsibility to encourage pupils, and create the right opportunities for them to experience the joy of learning to become life-long learners. I believe that with an open, positive mind, and a kind heart I can guide pupils to believe in themselves and at the same time embrace the differences in others."_
