### School Counsellors

**Mdm Nur Rahmah Binte Ja'afar** <br>
[nur\_rahmah\_jaafar@schools.gov.sg](mailto:nur_rahmah_jaafar@schools.gov.sg) <br>

I believe that each child has the potential to bloom. It is our duty to shower them with not only curriculum knowledge and skills, but also social emotional skills so that they can reach their fullest potential.

### Special Educational Needs Officers

**Mdm Janarthanan Lakshmi**<br>
[lakshmi\_janarthanan@schools.gov.sg](mailto:lakshmi_janarthanan@schools.gov.sg) <br>

I believe that as teachers it is our responsibility to encourage pupils, and create the right opportunities for them to experience the joy of learning to become life-long learners. I believe that with an open, positive mind, and a kind heart I can guide pupils to believe in themselves and at the same time embrace the differences in others.

All children are unique and must have a stimulating educational environment where they can grow mentally, emotionally, and socially. It is my desire to create this type of atmosphere where students can meet their full potential.

Every child is a gift! The joy the receiver receives, comes from the process of unwrapping the gift. Like every gift, the strength of each child can only be uncovered through the process of “unwrapping”. I am the receiver and I seek to discover the unique giftings of every student that I work with.
