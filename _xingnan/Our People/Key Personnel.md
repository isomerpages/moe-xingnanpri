### Key Personnel

#### School Leaders

**Mrs Cindy Ong** <br>

The greatest gift an educator can give his/her students is to arouse and sustain their innate curiosity to learn, make meaning and construct knowledge through play while interacting with others, and their environment.

**Mdm S Anitha**   
Vice-Principal  
  
"When we seek to bring out the best in others, we somehow bring out the best in ourselves!” ~ William Arthur Ward

Teaching and learning is so full of excitement, wonder and joy that I am thrilled when one more pupil or colleague feels motivated to take up the challenge to try and learn something new and do their best in that endeavour! My belief is that we are unique individuals and have something special that we can bring to our own learning! It is a great feeling to provide children and peers opportunities to explore various ways to think and be committed to be a lifelong learner seeking knowledge and skills as they grow and serve others. As a school community, we can join hands to nurture our children to be confident individuals and responsible citizens!

Today's teachers like yesterday's teachers will continue to engage the learners to develop holistically, be a good person and loyal to the country. But the approaches, the tools and technology used will have to evolve and be in sync with the current times in order to engage the learners' curiosity and interest.
