The greatest gift an educator can give his/her students is to arouse and sustain their innate curiosity to learn, make meaning and construct knowledge through play while interacting with others, and their environment.

_"When we seek to bring out the best in others, we somehow bring out the best in ourselves!"  
Quote by William Arthur Ward_

  

_Teaching and learning is so full of excitement, wonder and joy that I am thrilled when one more pupil or colleague feels motivated to take up the challenge to try and learn something new and do their best in that endeavour! My belief is that we are unique individuals and have something special that we can bring to our own learning! It is a great feeling to provide children and peers opportunities to explore various ways to think and be committed to be a lifelong learner seeking knowledge and skills as they grow and serve others. As a school community, we can join hands to nurture our children to be confident individuals and responsible citizens!_

_“It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop” ~ Confucius_

 As you begin to take action towards achieving your goals, you must realize that not every action will be perfect.  What matters is to learn from what went wrong and do it better the next time. If you keep pushing towards your goal, one day, you will achieve it.
