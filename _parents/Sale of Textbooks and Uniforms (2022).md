Arrangements have been made with our bookshop vendor, HB Book Centre, and uniform vendor, Asencio Pte Ltd to carry out these online purchasing processes.  

You may purchase directly from the vendors’ websites and select your mode of receipt – Home Delivery Service or Self-Collection at school. Self-collection at school will be **strictly based on appointments only**. You may indicate your preferred time and date when you make your orders.  

Please note that we will be limiting the entry to school to only 1 parent and 1 student. Please present a copy of the email notification or screenshot of the email to the school security guards for verification.
