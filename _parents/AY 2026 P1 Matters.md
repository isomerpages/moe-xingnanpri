<p><strong>Dear Parents,</strong>
</p>
<p>Welcome to Xingnan Primary School! We’re delighted to have you and your
child join our school — and to our returning families, a warm welcome back!</p>
<p>In addition to the administrative matters page, this section will help
you prepare for <strong>Orientation Day</strong>, which will be held on <strong>21 November 2025 (Friday), from 9.00 a.m. to 11.00 a.m.</strong>
</p>
<p>Please mark the date and time in your calendar. More details will be shared
here as we get closer to the event, so do check back regularly for updates.</p>
