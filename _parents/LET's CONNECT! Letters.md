<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p>Starting this year, we will no longer publish the termly digital newsletters.
Instead, we are committed to providing you with timely updates through
our social media platforms.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each term, you will receive a <strong>LETâ€™s-CONNECT Letters</strong>,
which will highlight key updates and information for the term ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you for staying connected with us!</p>
