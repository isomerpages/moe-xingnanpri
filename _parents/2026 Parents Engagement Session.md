<h4><strong>2026 Parents Engagement Session</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Parents,</p>
<p><strong>Welcome, and thank you for joining us for the 2026 Parent Engagement Sessions.</strong>
<br>The recordings for each session will be made available after the live
sessions and can be accessed via the link provided.</p>
<p>These sessions offer valuable insights into our school’s programmes, initiatives,
and how we can work together to support our students’ learning journey.
If you were unable to attend the live sessions or would like to revisit
key discussions, we encourage you to view the recordings at your convenience.</p>
<p>Parents are also welcome to watch the <strong>Principal’s Address video</strong>,
which shares important updates and the school’s direction for the year
ahead.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued partnership and support in your child’s education.
Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.</p>
<p></p>
