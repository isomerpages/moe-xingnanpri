### Student Icon

Dear Xingnanians,  
  
You are now officially enrolled in MOE Student iCON. You are required to activate your Student iCON account in the coming weeks. We will be moving from our school-based email _(slsid@xnps.edu.sg)_ to the Student iCON (name@students.edu.sg) for the 2022 teaching and learning session. **Do you know what is student iCON is?**  
Student iCON is a suite of Google apps including emails and other apps services such as Google Classroom and Docs that helps to better support your learning in the following ways. 

*   Support self-directed and collaborative learning
*   Enhance Teaching and Learning
*   Support the Development of Digital Literacies 

Student iCON is similar to our current school domain (@xnps.edu.sg) but comes with more features such as Google apps, Zoom, and Microsoft Office ProPlus.  
  
These useful applications will be provided progressively and will follow you throughout your learning journey from Primary School to Junior college.  
  
**Does this means we will not use our school (xnps.edu.sg) email.?**  

Yes, we will no longer use the school-based email (@xnps.edu.sg) that is assigned to you, instead, we will be using the  MOE iCON (@students.edu.sg) email account.
