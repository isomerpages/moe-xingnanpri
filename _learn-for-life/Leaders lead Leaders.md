### Leaders Lead Leaders

Bearing holistic education as the core of our belief, the school sees the importance of self-discipline in playing a major role in pupil development.  To achieve this, school needs to have a common set of language/habit to anchor all programmes to ensure coherence and relevance to promote organisational excellence. Through our Leaders Lead Leaders Programme, we aim to develop staff and pupils to be highly effective people where they have a common ‘language’ in habits across curricular and co-curricular departments and subjects. This would allow our staff and pupils to experience a coherent and specific spiral approach from developing personal effectiveness to interpersonal effectiveness and as a result, they would learn to be preventive and proactive individuals.
