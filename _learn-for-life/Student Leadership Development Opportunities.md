<h3>Student Leadership Development Opportunities</h3>
<p></p>
<p>At Xingnan, we believe that every student has the potential to be developed
as a leader, with each possessing a unique blend of abilities and talents.
Guided by this belief, we provide a range of student leadership development
opportunities to nurture students towards their fullest leadership potential,
enabling them to grow into confident individuals, self-directed learners,
and compassionate leaders.</p>
<p>To support this, we offer a three-tier student leadership progression
pathway, complemented by role-specific leadership training and meaningful
service opportunities. Through these experiences, student leaders are entrusted
with responsibilities that allow them to apply their skills, gain valuable
experience, and contribute purposefully to the school community.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Switching of Student Leadership Pathways</u>.&nbsp; Student Leaders
and Interns are expected to relinquish their current appointments if they
wish to pursue a different student leadership pathway, after consulting
their parents and teacher-in-charge. These students would then need to
progress through the pathway again, starting from Tier 1B.</p>

<p>Every student plays a role in supporting peers and contributes to the
school’s network of positive relationships. Peers are an important source
of support, especially for adolescents who often turn to friends before
adults.</p>
<p>Students who show a desire to build class community and care for others
may develop as Peer Support Leaders (PSLs). PSLs are trained to support
classmates, recognise signs of distress, and refer peers to teachers or
trusted adults when needed. They also promote positive mindsets, prosocial
behaviours online and offline, and model good character.&nbsp;</p>

</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>All junior and senior student leaders (Tiers 2 and 3) will be formally
appointed and recognised during the annual Student Leadership Investiture.
This event serves to instil a sense of responsibility and commitment among
both incumbent and newly appointed leaders as they take on the important
role of guiding and serving their peers. As a visible symbol of their leadership,
all junior and senior student leaders will wear a specially designed badge
on their school uniform.</p>
<p>With this responsibility, student leaders are expected to carry out their
roles with dedication, integrity, and professionalism. They are entrusted
to act responsibly, serve as role models, and contribute positively to
the school community. Leadership positions are best held by students who
demonstrate consistent effort and uphold school values, and those who face
challenges in meeting expectations may be guided to step aside, ensuring
that leadership roles are fulfilled effectively</p>
