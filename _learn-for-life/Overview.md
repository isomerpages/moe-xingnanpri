### Learn for Life

At Xingnan, every child is given various opportunities to acquire skills and knowledge which will stay with them for life to help them lead dignified lives, fulfill their aspirations and contribute to society. Every pupil is taught to practice how to be adaptable and resilient, far-sighted and rooted, independent and collaborative, kind and confident and values-driven and critical. Our school values lead our pupils to be self-directed learners and gracious citizens through the Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Learn for Life Programme (LLP), X³ Learning Years Programme ( X³ LYP).   

  

“ ‘Learn for Life’ is a value, an attitude and a skill that our students need to possess and it is fundamental in ensuring that education remains an uplifting force in society.” Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung MOE Workplan Seminar 2019.

  

Our Xingnan educators Lead, Care and Inspire our pupils to be their BEST at all that they do! Our educators take charge of their professional growth, balance their well-being and learn from one another’s experiences. Our Xingnan educators are our stars that bring light to our pupils.
