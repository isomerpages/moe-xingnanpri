<h3>Leaders Lead Leaders</h3>
Bearing holistic education as the core of our belief, the school sees
the importance of self-discipline in playing a major role in pupil development.&nbsp;&nbsp;To
achieve this, school needs to have a common set of language/habit to anchor
all programmes to ensure coherence and relevance to promote organisational
excellence. Through our Leaders Lead Leaders Programme, we aim to&nbsp;develop
staff and pupils to be highly effective people&nbsp;where they&nbsp;have
a common ‘language’ in habits across curricular and co-curricular departments
and subjects. This would allow our staff and pupils to&nbsp;experience
a coherent and specific spiral approach from developing personal effectiveness
to interpersonal effectiveness&nbsp;and as a result, they would learn to
be preventive and proactive individuals.<p></p>

<h4>Lighthouse training for EXCO Prefects &amp; Primary 5 &amp; Primary 6 CCA Leaders</h4>
In Xingnan, the EXCO Prefects and Primary 5/6 CCA Leaders go through a lighthouse training facilitated by the Franklin Covey team. Through this training, they learn to internalize and apply the 7 Habits effectively. Through this session, our Student Leaders, are empowered to reinforce them through practical application, feedback and coaching. This training also develops Student Leaders to be effective individuals, great leaders and 7 Habits Ambassadors.


<h4>Teaching of the 7 habits&nbsp;</h4>
Students internalize the 7 habits through our comprehensive lesson packages conducted during the weekly Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) lessons and through our Start It Right, Keep It Right &amp; End It Right lesson packages conducted on the first day of school. Teachers revisit the habits with the pupils. Pupils learn the habits through hands-on activities and conversations with their peers and teachers.
