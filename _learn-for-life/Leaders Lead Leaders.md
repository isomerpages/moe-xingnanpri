<p>Bearing holistic education as the core of our belief, the school sees
the importance of self-discipline in playing a major role in pupil development.&nbsp;&nbsp;To
achieve this, school needs to have a common set of language/habit to anchor
all programmes to ensure coherence and relevance to promote organisational
excellence. Through our Leaders Lead Leaders Programme, we aim to&nbsp;develop
staff and pupils to be highly effective people&nbsp;where they&nbsp;have
a common ‘language’ in habits across curricular and co-curricular departments
and subjects. This would allow our staff and pupils to&nbsp;experience
a coherent and specific spiral approach from developing personal effectiveness
to interpersonal effectiveness&nbsp;and as a result, they would learn to
be preventive and proactive individuals.</p>
