### Leaders Lead Leaders

Bearing holistic education as the core of our belief, the school sees the importance of self-discipline in playing a major role in pupil development.&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this, school needs to have a common set of language/habit to anchor all programmes to ensure coherence and relevance to promote organisational excellence. Through our Leaders Lead Leaders Programme, we aim to&nbsp;develop staff and pupils to be highly effective people&nbsp;where they&nbsp;have a common ‘language’ in habits across curricular and co-curricular departments and subjects. This would allow our staff and pupils to&nbsp;experience a coherent and specific spiral approach from developing personal effectiveness to interpersonal effectiveness&nbsp;and as a result, they would learn to be preventive and proactive individuals.
