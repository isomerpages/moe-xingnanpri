Through our various programmes and initiatives such as ‘Ecobingo’, Trash for Treasure, Shoe Recycling (Old Shoe New Future), and collaboration with stakeholders, we aim to educate the school about sustainable living by getting pupils to be **aware**, **apply** what they know and be **advocates** of sustainability (3A Approach).
