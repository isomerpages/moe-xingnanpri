<img src="/images/xlp2.png" style="width:200px;height:240px;margin-left:15px;" align="right"> In 2017, Xingnan Primary introduced the X3&nbsp;Learning Years Programme (X3&nbsp;LYP), beginning with P1 level. X3&nbsp;LYP provides an approach to learning in 2-year blocks, focusing on providing opportunities for students to develop a range of skills through Curricular and Co-Curricular subjects, at different stages of their education journey in primary school. X3&nbsp;stands for the  
acronyms XCITE, XPLORE and XTEND The X in each of these acronyms stands for Xingnan, because this programme is unique to Xingnan.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  

a.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;X**CITE**&nbsp;at the lower primary block focuses on&nbsp;**C**urriculum&nbsp;**I**ntegration through&nbsp;**T**hematic Experiences.

  

b.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;X**PLORE**&nbsp;at the middle block focuses on providing&nbsp;**P**urposeful&nbsp;**L**earning&nbsp;**O**pportunities through&nbsp;**R**esource-rich **E**nvironments

  

c.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;X**TEND**&nbsp;at the upper block focuses on&nbsp;**T**ransforming&nbsp;**E**xperiences through i**N**novation and&nbsp;**D**iscovery.

  

X3&nbsp;LYP seeks to facilitate coherence between&nbsp;**Curricular**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Co-Curricular**&nbsp;subjects and across the different levels. The X3&nbsp;LYP offers students a range of learning experiences using integration of curriculum through themes, learning journeys and resource-rich environments&nbsp; to make their learning more authentic, relevant, meaningful and engaging. The programme is intended to extend their learning beyond classrooms and better prepare them as future-oriented, gracious citizens.
