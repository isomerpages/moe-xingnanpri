X3 LYP provides an approach to learning in 2-year blocks, focusing on providing opportunities for students to develop a range of skills through Curricular and Co-Curricular subjects, at different stages of their education journey in primary school. X3 stands for the  
acronyms XCITE, XPLORE and XTEND The X in each of these acronyms stands for Xingnan, because this programme is unique to Xingnan.  

  

a.       X**CITE** at the lower primary block focuses on **C**urriculum **I**ntegration through **T**hematic Experiences.

  

b.       X**PLORE** at the middle block focuses on providing **P**urposeful **L**earning **O**pportunities through **R**esource-rich **E**nvironments

The programme is intended to extend their learning beyond classrooms and better prepare them as future-oriented, gracious citizens.
