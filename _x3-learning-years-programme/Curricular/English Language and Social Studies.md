<h3>English Language and Social Studies</h3>
<h2><strong>English</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Curriculum Framework</strong>
</p>
<p>The MOE English Language Syllabus 2020 for the Primary level focuses on
the development, reinforcement and extension of language skills in the
primary years through an enjoyment of the language and the promotion of
extensive reading; and leveraging oracy, reading and writing skills to
develop knowledge and independent use of the language.
<br>
<br>The diagram below presents the key features of the EL Syllabus 2020.</p>

<p>At Xingnan, we nurture our students to be empathetic communicators, discerning
readers, and creative inquirers who use the English Language with both
impact and affect. Xingnanians engage with authentic language daily by
listening to their teachers read aloud and accessing a wide variety of
audiobooks in the library. These experiences allow them to model fluent
and expressive speech patterns. As discerning readers, they read widely
and critically across various genres and formats, including both print
and digital texts. Apart from exposing students to contemporary literary
works and publications, they are also encouraged to keep abreast with current
affairs using the Little Red Dot by the Straits Times.</p>
<p>In the classroom, students practice speaking confidently and empathetically
by sharing their thoughts and engaging in meaningful discussions using
Talk Moves. Through exploring a range of writing styles, techniques, and
skills, Xingnanians develop their own unique voice to express ideas clearly
and meaningfully in writing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Key Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><u>EL Enrich</u>
</p>
<p>EL Enrich is a customised programme designed for linguistically proficient
Primary 4 to Primary 6 students.</p>
<p>In the first semester, students participate in reading circles featuring
award-winning literature. Working in collaborative groups, they engage
with acclaimed texts through structured discussions that foster critical
analysis, deepen comprehension, and cultivate personal connections with
literature. This approach develops both academic discourse skills and autonomous
learning habits.</p>
<p>In the second semester, students examine contemporary civic and global
issues by adopting the approach of Inquiry Through Dialogue. These facilitated
discussions cultivate essential 21st Century Competencies - critical thinking,
communication, collaboration, and global awarenes - as students analyse
multiple perspectives, evaluate sources, and articulate informed viewpoints.
Through this engagement with real-world complexities, students develop
the analytical skills and empathetic understanding necessary for responsible
global citizenship.</p>
<p><strong><u>Reading Programme with The Little Red Dot</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To cultivate globally minded students capable of critically examining
contemporary issues, our school integrates <em>The Little Red Dot</em> as
an essential pedagogical resource. The educational publication enables
students to develop informed perspectives on local and international developments
while strengthening analytical competencies.</p>
<p>Through guided exploration of topical issues, students evaluate multiple
perspectives, question assumptions, and synthesise complex information.
This engagement bridges classroom learning with real-world applications,
deepening their understanding of social, economic, and global dynamics.</p>
<p>Students actively share their insights by journalling their thoughts and
posting them on the Little Red Dot corners in their classrooms. Additionally,
students also present at assembly sessions, fostering a school-wide culture
of informed discourse and civic engagement.</p>
<p><strong><u>Learning Support Programmes</u></strong>
</p>
<p><u>Learning Support Programme (LSP)</u>
</p>
<p>The Learning Support Programme (LSP) is a specialised early reading intervention
programme that provides additional support to Primary 1 and Primary 2 students
who would benefit from strengthening their foundational skills. Delivered
through daily 30 minutes lessons in small groups of 8 to 10 students, trained
LSP teachers focus on systematic phonics instruction to level up studentsâ€™
English language and literacy skills.</p>
<p><strong><u>School-Based Dyslexia Programme (SDR)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR) Programme is a specialised
and intensive literacy intervention programme. It addresses the individual
literacy needs of Primary 3 and 4 students with dyslexia, particularly
those with significant difficulties in reading and spelling.</p>
<p>Conducted in weekly cycles, each SDR cycle consists of three 1-hour sessions
held after school. The frequency of sessions is necessary to provide students
with sufficient opportunities for practice and to regularly reinforce their
learning</p>
<p><strong><u>Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Primary 3 and Primary 4 Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) aims to
enhance the reading competency of students who require targeted intervention
to strengthen their literacy skills at the word and text levels. The objectives
are to enable students to read grade-level texts with fluency, and to demonstrate
understanding of these texts. These sessions are conducted after school
with a trained RRP teacher.&nbsp;At the Primary 5 level, the lessons are
conducted both in curriculum and after school</p>
<p><strong><u>After School Programme (ASP)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In addition to MOE-initiated support programmes, the English Language
Department identifies students who would benefit from enhanced language
support for the After School Programme. For 2025, the focus is on strengthening
reading comprehension skills and strategies through specially curated teaching
and learning resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
