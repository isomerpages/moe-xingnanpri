<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<h4>Curriculum Framework</h4>
<p>The central focus of the Mathematics curriculum is the development of
mathematical problem-solving competency. Supporting this focus are five
inter-related components (in Figure 1) – concepts, skills, processes, metacognition
and attitudes.</p>

</div>
<p>Our school supports Xingnanians in achieving mastery in Mathematics through
a multifaceted approach that nurtures critical and creative thinking. It
emphasizes <strong>Exploration &amp; Discovery</strong>, providing students
with opportunities to analyze mathematical situations and uncover concepts
independently, fostering inquisitiveness. Through <strong>Communication</strong>,
learners are encouraged to articulate and discuss their ideas, helping
them develop reasoning skills and refine their mathematical language. <strong>Meaningful Learning</strong> is
promoted by connecting mathematical concepts to real-life situations, enhancing
understanding and relevance. Additionally, our school integrates <strong>Manipulatives and Technological Aids</strong> to
offer hands-on learning experiences, enabling students to bridge abstract
concepts with concrete understanding. This comprehensive strategy equips
students to think logically, abstractly, critically, and creatively.</p>

<p><strong>Key Programmes and Learning Experiences</strong>
</p>
<p>At Xingnan Primary School, the primary aims of the Mathematics curriculum
are for students to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Acquire mathematical concepts and skills for everyday use and continuous
learning in mathematics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive
skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build confidence and foster interest in mathematics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our Mathematics lessons and programmes focus on developing experiential
learning, and promoting self-directed learning through ICT tools.</p>
<p><em>CPA Approach</em>
</p>
<p>The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract Approach (CPA) is used in Mathematics
lessons to develop a strong understanding of Mathematical concepts.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Concrete (“Doing” stage): Use of concrete objects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pictorial (“Seeing” stage): Use of representations of objects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abstract (“Symbolic stage): Use of abstract symbols &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Students learning about different views of solid figures. &nbsp;&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p><em>STAR Approach</em>
</p>
<p>Students will be exposed to different types of heuristics skills. They
will be taught how to approach different problems using Polya’s four steps
to problem-solving or the STAR approach – <strong>Study</strong> the question, <strong>Think</strong> of
a plan, <strong>Act</strong> on the plan and <strong>Reflect</strong> on the
answer.</p>
<p><em>KooBits</em>
</p>
<p>All Primary 1 to 6 students are given access to KooBits, an online Mathematics
learning platform designed to encourage self-directed learning with minimal
teacher supervision. Through positive reinforcement and motivation, KooBits
offers interactive and engaging learning experiences via collaborative
tasks, competitive games and rewards such as badges and virtual credits.
With consistent practice, students develop proficiency and achieve mastery
of the skills taught in class.</p>
<p><em>E2K Programme</em>
</p>
<p>The E2K Mathematics Programme is for selected Primary 4 to Primary 6 students
who display interest and aptitude for Mathematics. It aims to develop students'
mathematical reasoning skills and deepens their understanding through an
inquiry approach. They are engaged in mathematical thinking through resources
such as puzzles, games and mathematical explorations. This programme helps
students develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions mathematicians
possess and gain important 21st century competencies skills.</p>
<p><em>Learning Support in Mathematics Programme</em>
</p>
<p>The Learning Support in Mathematics (LSM) programme provides early intervention
for Primary 1 to Primary 4 students who require additional support, with
a focus on developing numeracy skills. The programme focuses on basic mathematical
skills and concepts to build a strong foundation. It aims to develop students’
confidence and foster positive beliefs in their ability to do Mathematics.
A key feature of LSM is the smaller class size, which allows for more individual
attention from the teacher. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Achievements</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to participate in the Mathematics competitions
to demonstrate their Mathematics skills and motivate them to strive for
excellence in the learning of Mathematics. Some competitions students take
part in include (i) Asia Pacific Mathematical Olympiad for Primary Schools;
(ii) Raffles Mathematical Olympiad; and (iii) National Mathematical Olympiad
of Singapore. &nbsp;</p>
