### Science 

Our Science department aims to nurture Xingnanians to be self-directed learners, creative collaborators, curious inquirers and critical thinkers. Through the 3C approach â€” capture, construct and consolidate, pupils will be engaged, construct their understanding and consolidate what they have learnt. Through the use of thinking routine, Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER), the pupils will be led through the Scientific inquiry process to learn more about the natural world. <br><br><img style="width:60%" src="/images/sci1.png"><br><br><b>Our iconic programmes and activities</b><br><br><b>Young Scientist Programme</b><br><br> <img align="left" style="width:290px;height:180px;margin-right:30px;" src="/images/ysp.gif">  The Young Scientist Badge Scheme was designed for primary school pupils, with the following objectives:&nbsp;<br><br>
