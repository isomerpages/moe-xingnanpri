<p> Science Department <br><br>

Our Science department aims to nurture Xingnanians to be self-directed learners, creative collaborators, curious inquirers and critical thinkers. Through the 3C approach — capture, construct and consolidate, pupils will be engaged, construct their understanding and consolidate what they have learnt. Through the use of thinking routine, Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER), the pupils will be led through the Scientific inquiry process to learn more about the natural world. <br><br><img src="/images/sci1.png" style="width:60%"><br><br><b>Our iconic programmes and activities</b><br><br><b>Young Scientist Programme</b><br><br> <img src="/images/ysp.gif" style="width:290px;height:180px;margin-right:30px;" align = "left">  The Young Scientist Badge Scheme was designed for primary school pupils, with the following objectives: <br><br>

*   To stimulate interest in science activities among pupils. <br>

*   To enable pupils to carry out self-directed activities in various disciplines of science.  <br>

*   To provide opportunities for pupils to develop initiative and creativity. <br><br>

	<b>Excellence 2000 (E2K) Science</b> <br><br><img src="/images/e2s.gif" style="width:220px;height:180px;margin-right:30px;" align = "left"> The E2K Science Programme offers opportunities for pupils to engage in scientific investigations to discover and deepen their understanding of advanced science concepts through an inquiry approach. The rich learning experiences offered by the programme serve to help pupils to:  <br><br>

*   Develop the habits, attitudes and dispositions scientists possess. <br>

*   Gain important 21st century competencies such as critical thinking, invention thinking and effective communication skills. <br><br> <b>Math Meets Science (MMS) Week </b> <br><br> <iframe width="535" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kK5WjEtnT90" title="Math Meets Science 2021 CLOSURE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <Br><br> MMS Week aims to:  <br><br>

*   Curate meaningful learning experiences to foster seamless connections between Math and Science. This programme is also linked to our XCITE curriculum. <br>
*   Provide hands-on learning experiences and draw meaningful connections with real-world applications. This programme is also linked to our XTEND curriculum. <br>
*   Gain problem-solving skills, exploratory learning, and critical thinking that go hand-in-hand with the two subjects. This programme is also linked to our XPLORE curriculum. <br><br> <b> Science Centre Enrichment Lesson</b> <br><br> Put slides here. <br><br> As part of our school’s Science enrichment programme, the Primary 6 pupils went for an enrichment course at the Science Centre. It will be a platform for our pupils to extend their learning of Science beyond the textbook and classroom. The objectives of the programme are for the pupils to: <br><br>

\-Observe and identify the different organisms found in a pond. <Br>

\-Understand the different adaptation of the plants and animals found in a pond. <br>

\-Identify the roles of various organisms in a food chain and food web.

<p> Include missing images here. <br><br>Two teams participated in the 2021 Junior Science Whiz Challenge which was jointly organised by West Zone Centre of Excellence and Technology (WZCOE) @ River Valley High School and RV Science Leaders Academy. The challenge was conducted via Zoom online. Participants first went through the individual MCQ Round and then the Stage Round in teams. Jin Zi Jie from 6A did well and came in 21st place in the individual MCQ Round. He was awarded a Certificate of Achievement and a $5 Popular Gift Voucher. Although both teams did not manage to get into the Stage Round to compete with the other school teams, our pupils had gained valuable learning experience from the challenge.</p>

<p><img src="/images/sbp.gif" style="width:290px;height:180px;margin-right:30px;" align = "left">In 2020, Erik Pasquale from 4A, Phan Thu Linh from 4B, and Janice Wong Xin Yi from 4D represented Xingnan Primary School in the Science Buskers Festival 2020 organised by Singapore Science Centre. This event aims to promote the learning of Science in an engaging way as well as the generating of interest in creative Science communications and expressions.  
  
Due to Covid-19, Science Buskers Festival was conducted online. Participants had to submit their online videos instead of busking together with their peers in front of the judges. Erik, Thu Linh, and Janice came up with ideas for their videos with the help of their parents and teachers before filming individually at home. All of them put in a lot of effort in conducting their experiments multiple times and learning to edit their own videos.  
  
Xingnan Primary School is proud to announce that Phan Thu Linh from 4B has won the Judges’ Choice Award this year! She was also featured in the student publication Thumbs Up section in Lianhe Zaobao. You can read the article <a href="https://www.zbschools.sg/news/local/stories-16621">here</a>.  
  
Congratulations, Thu Linh! We would also like to take this opportunity to commend Erik and Janice for their wonderful effort! Well done, Xingnanians!
