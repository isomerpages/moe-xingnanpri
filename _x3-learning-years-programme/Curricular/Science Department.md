<p> Science Department <br><br>

Our Science department aims to nurture Xingnanians to be self-directed learners, creative collaborators, curious inquirers and critical thinkers. Through the 3C approach — capture, construct and consolidate, pupils will be engaged, construct their understanding and consolidate what they have learnt. Through the use of thinking routine, Claim-Evidence-Reasoning (CER), the pupils will be led through the Scientific inquiry process to learn more about the natural world. <br><br><img src="/images/sci1.png" style="width:60%"><br><br><b>Our iconic programmes and activities</b><br><br><b>Young Scientist Programme</b><br><br> <img src="/images/ysp.gif" style="width:290px;height:180px;margin-right:30px;" align = "left">  The Young Scientist Badge Scheme was designed for primary school pupils, with the following objectives: <br><br>

<p> Include missing images here. <br><br>Two teams participated in the 2021 Junior Science Whiz Challenge which was jointly organised by West Zone Centre of Excellence and Technology (WZCOE) @ River Valley High School and RV Science Leaders Academy. The challenge was conducted via Zoom online. Participants first went through the individual MCQ Round and then the Stage Round in teams. Jin Zi Jie from 6A did well and came in 21st place in the individual MCQ Round. He was awarded a Certificate of Achievement and a $5 Popular Gift Voucher. Although both teams did not manage to get into the Stage Round to compete with the other school teams, our pupils had gained valuable learning experience from the challenge.</p>
