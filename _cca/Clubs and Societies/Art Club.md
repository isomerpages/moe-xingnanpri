<h3>Art Club</h3>
<p>Our Art Club Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) provides students with a creative
space to explore and develop their artistic talents across various mediums,
including drawing, painting, sculpture, and digital art. It encourages
self-expression, imagination, and experimentation while fostering an appreciation
for visual arts.</p>
<p>Through workshops, collaborative projects, and participation in school
exhibitions and competitions, members learn different techniques, refine
their skills, and gain confidence in presenting their work. The Art Club
also promotes teamwork, critical thinking, and problem-solving, as students
share ideas and inspire one another.</p>
<p>More than just creating art, this CCA nurtures a lifelong love for creativity,
helping students express themselves, think innovatively, and enjoy the
fulfilling process of turning ideas into tangible works of art.</p>
