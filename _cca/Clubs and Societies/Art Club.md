### Art Club

The Art Club provides an opportunity for pupils who have strong interest in art-making to explore materials and techniques more extensively. It provides a platform for pupils from different classes and levels to interact and engage in art-making collaboratively. Pupils enjoy a safe environment to experiment and express themselves creatively.
