### Chinese Cultural Appreciation Club

Chinese Calligraphy is a traditional culture spanning thousands of years. Learning Chinese Calligraphy helps the pupils nurture patience. By practicing Chinese Calligraphy, pupils learn to practice strokes with patience. Pupils develop the skill to focus and concentrate, an important quality which will help them in other aspects of their life. At the same time, they form lasting friendships and camaraderie in Chinese Calligraphy Club. We welcome all pupils to join our club to experience the beauty of writing Chinese Calligraphy and be part of the tradition that span thousands of years.
