<h3>Chinese Cultural Appreciation Club</h3>
<p>Chinese Calligraphy is a traditional culture spanning thousands of years.
Learning Chinese Calligraphy helps the pupils nurture patience. By practicing
Chinese Calligraphy, pupils learn to practice strokes with patience. Pupils
develop the skill to focus and concentrate, an important quality which
will help them in other aspects of their life. At the same time, they form
lasting friendships and camaraderie in Chinese Calligraphy Club. We welcome
all pupils to join our club to experience the beauty of writing Chinese
Calligraphy and be part of the tradition that span thousands of years.</p>
