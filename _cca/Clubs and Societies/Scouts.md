### Scouts

The Cub Scouts CCA is a fun and adventurous activity that builds character, resilience, and teamwork in our young members. Rooted in the values of the worldwide Scouting movement, Cub Scouts encourages students to learn new skills, care for the environment, and serve the community while developing confidence and responsibility.

Through hands-on activities such as outdoor adventures, camping skills, first aid, knot-tying, and community projects, members cultivate independence, problem-solving abilities, and a strong sense of camaraderie. At the same time, they live out the Scout Law and Promise, nurturing values such as honesty, respect, and helpfulness.
