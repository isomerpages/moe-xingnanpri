### Scouts

Scouting encourages the holistic physical, mental, spiritual and social development of youth with a strong emphasis on duty to God, duty to country, and helping other people. At a national level, Singapore Scouts Association organises annual camps such as Cub Scout Leadership Camps (West Area). During this camp, our cub scouts learn leadership skills through fun-filled and exciting activities and programmes. Our cub scouts discover, learn and put into practice essential life skills through serving others and learning by doing.
