### Pottery Club

We create pieces of clay artwork with tools and clay. Pupils get to learn about the different kinds of clays, mediums that we could explore and use for their artwork. They will learn how to use the manual wheel to make a bowl or dish, kneading methods etc. On top of that, we will empower the upper primary pupils to lead and impart their skills to the juniors.Â Through the activities designed for Pottery Club, we hope to cultivate these values, namely patience, perseverance and creativity in our members.
