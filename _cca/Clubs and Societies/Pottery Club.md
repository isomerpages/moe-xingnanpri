<h3>Pottery Club</h3>
<p>Xingnan Primary’s Pottery Club&nbsp; offers students a creative and hands-on
experience in the art of shaping clay into functional and decorative pieces.
Through this club, members learn fundamental techniques such as hand-building,
wheel-throwing, glazing, and finishing, while developing patience, precision,
and artistic expression.</p>
<p>Beyond skill development, pottery encourages creativity, mindfulness,
and problem-solving, as students experiment with forms, textures, and designs.
Students also gain opportunities to showcase their work in school exhibitions,
competitions, and community events.</p>
<p>Our Pottery Club does not focus only on making art—it is a space where
students cultivate confidence, perseverance, and a love for the creative
process, all while enjoying the satisfaction of turning raw clay into unique,
tangible creations.</p>
