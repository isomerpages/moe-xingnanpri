<h3>Chinese Dance</h3>
<p>Our Chinese Dance Co-Curriucular Activity (CCA) is a vibrant and expressive
platform where students explore the beauty of traditional and contemporary
Chinese dance. Rooted in rich cultural heritage, Chinese dance combines
graceful movements, storytelling, and artistry to celebrate centuries of
history and tradition.</p>
<p>Through this CCA, students not only improve their coordination, grace,
and fitness but also gain a deeper appreciation of Chinese culture. The
CCA nurtures teamwork and resilience, as dancers work together to achieve
harmony and precision in every performance.</p>
