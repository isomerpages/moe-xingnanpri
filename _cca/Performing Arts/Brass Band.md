### Brass Band

Xingnan Primary School first started her band in 1982 with only 20 members.  To date, the band is strong and active with about 80 members.  

  

Our Brass Band aspires to create music that reaches the listeners' hearts.  We participate actively in local and overseas music exchange programmes in Brisbane (2013) and Taiwan (2016) to enrich our members' musical experiences. The educational trip to Brisbane, Australia and Taipei, Taiwan provided opportunities for band members to interact with youth musicians across borders and to develop a deeper understanding of musicianship. They get to experience music from different cultures and value their learning as a life long continuous experience!
