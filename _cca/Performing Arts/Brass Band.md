### Brass Band



Xingnan Primary School first started her band in 1982 with only 20 members.&nbsp; To date, the band is strong and active with about 80 members.

The School Brass Band is a vibrant and dynamic musical ensemble that brings together students who share a passion for music, teamwork, and performance.Our band is made up of brass instruments including the trumpets, cornets, trombones, tubas, and supported by percussion.

Beyond learning to play music, members of the Brass Band develop discipline, confidence, and a strong sense of community. Students practice regularly, perform at school events, concerts, and community functions, and proudly represent the school in competitions and festivals.

The band welcomes players of all skill levels—from beginners eager to learn to experienced musicians looking to refine their talents. With guidance from dedicated instructors, students not only improve musically but also grow as individuals, building friendships and memories that last a lifetime.

Being part of the Brass Band is more than just playing music—it’s about teamwork, creativity, and sharing the joy of music with others.
