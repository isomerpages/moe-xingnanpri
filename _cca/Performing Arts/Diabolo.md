<h3>Diabolo</h3>
<p>Xingnan Primary School is the only primary school in Singapore to offer
diabolo, a traditional Chinese game, as a CCA. Pupils play the traditional
Chinese yo-yo with ease, swinging the hourglass-shaped toy into the air
and juggling it using only a pair of wooden sticks and string.</p>
