### Indian Dance

Indian Dance has given the pupils the opportunity to explore various types of Indian dance forms i.e. Thappaattam - Folk dance, Kavadiattam, Bhangra, Bharathanaatiyam and many other Indian Classical dance forms! We hope to eXcite our pupils with many new dance forms. Through this CCA we hope to eXplore into various themes to broaden the knowledge about the various dance forms among our dancers.
