<h3>Indian Dance</h3>
<p>Our Indian Dance Co-Curriucular Activity (CCA) gives students the opportunity
to explore various types of Indian dance forms such as Thappaattam - Folk
dance, Kavadiattam, Bhangra, Bharathanaatiyam and other Indian Classical
dance forms.</p>
<p>Rooted in centuries-old traditions, Indian dance combines graceful gestures,
expressive facial movements, and dynamic choreography to bring stories,
emotions, and values to life.</p>
<p>Through this CCA we hope to provide a platform for self-expression, creativity,
and cultural pride, while nurturing a lifelong appreciation for the arts.</p>
