<h3>International Dance</h3>
<p>Xingnan Primary’s International Dance Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) is
a dynamic and inclusive platform that celebrates the diversity of cultures
around the world through the universal language of dance. Students are
exposed to a wide range of dance genres, from Latin and Bollywood to K-pop,
hip-hop, contemporary, and classical ballet dance.</p>
<p>Joining International Dance will allow students to express their emotions
and moods, as they embark on a journey of cultural discovery while growing
as versatile and confident performers.&nbsp;</p>
