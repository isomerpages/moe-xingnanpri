<h3>Malay Dance</h3>
<p>The Malay Dance Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) provides students with the
opportunity to immerse themselves in the rich cultural heritage of the
Malay community through traditional and contemporary dance. Rooted in grace,
rhythm, and storytelling, Malay dance reflects values of harmony, respect,
and community spirit.</p>
<p>Through regular training sessions, members learn fundamental techniques,
explore traditional dances such as Zapin, Inang, and Joget, and experience
how these art forms have evolved with modern influences. Beyond performance,
students develop discipline, confidence, teamwork, and an appreciation
of cultural diversity.</p>
<p>Members of the Malay Dance CCA are also given opportunities to showcase
their talents during school events, cultural festivals, and external competitions.
It is a vibrant and welcoming community where passion for the arts is nurtured,
and where students build lasting friendships while preserving and celebrating
culture.</p>
