<h3>Volleyball</h3>
<p>As a niche Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) in Xingnan,&nbsp; both our Volleyball
boy’ and girls’ teams are identified and selected during Physical Education
lessons, and try-outs conducted to gauge their physical attributes, psychomotor
skills and potential to join the teams at the end of Primary 2.</p>
<p>Set up in 2010, the aim of our Volleyball CCA is to instill the spirit
of team work, sportsmanship, loyalty, resilience and positive attitude
in our students.&nbsp; As one of the most dynamic and team-oriented sports,
we train our players in essential skills such as serving, spiking, blocking,
and receiving, while also developing agility, coordination, and overall
fitness.</p>
<p>Our teachers and coaches strongly believe that a player’s character determines
his performance on court. Thus, we emphasize CCA excellence through character
and leadership development. Notably, our P6 Volleyball girls have been
talent-scouted annually by secondary schools for Direct School Admissions
(DSA).</p>
