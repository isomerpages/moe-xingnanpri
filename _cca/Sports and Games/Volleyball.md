### Volleyball


Volleyball in Xingnan Primary School is a niche CCA. As such, pupils are identified and selected during Physical Education lessons as well as try-outs conducted to gauge their physical attributes, psychomotor skills and potential to join our volleyball team at the end of Primary 2.

  

The Volleyball CCA was set up in 2010. The objective of the Volleyball CCA is to instill the spirit of team work, sportsmanship, loyalty, resilience and positive attitude in pupils' We aim to build up volleyball skills in each player and give them the opportunity to participate in the annual West Zone and National Inter-School Volleyball Competitions. 

  

Our teachers and coaches strongly believe that a player’s character determines his performance in the court. Thus, we emphasize CCA excellence through character and leadership development. Our P6 Volleyball girls have been talent-scouted annually by secondary schools for Direct School Admissions (DSA).
