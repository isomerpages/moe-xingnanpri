### Soccer

We educate the importance of character building traits such as working hard to develop skills and good sportsmanship to the soccer players. They will experience healthy peer-group interactions and learn how to build friendships during practices, games and team activities. Our Soccer players are given many opportunities to communicate with one another respectfully and responsibly as they have to work together and help each other achieve the best in them.
