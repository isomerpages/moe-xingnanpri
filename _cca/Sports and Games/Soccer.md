<h3>Soccer</h3>
<p>Our Soccer Club provides students with the opportunity to develop their
skills, fitness, and teamwork in one of the worldâ€™s most popular sports.
Students learn fundamental techniques such as passing, dribbling, shooting,
and tactical strategies, while improving stamina, agility, and coordination.</p>
<p>Through regular training sessions, friendly matches, and participation
in inter-school competitions, students cultivate character building traits
such as discipline, perseverance and sportsmanship.&nbsp; Our Soccer players
are given many opportunities to communicate with one another respectfully
and responsibly as they have to work together and help each other achieve
the best in them.</p>
<p>Whether aiming to compete at a high level or simply enjoy the game, our
Soccer Club welcomes all students who would like to stay active, build
confidence, and develop a lifelong passion for the sport.</p>
