### Badminton 

At Xingnan Badminton, we aim to inculcate values of sportsmanship, discipline and resilience in our players. We believe that these values are crucial in preparing our players in and out of the court. With the shared passion for the sport, we are persistent in improving our techniques and footwork, constantly striving for excellence as we learn and grow as individuals and as a team. Through these common experiences, we forge a close-knitted team that encourages one another through this journey as a student-athlete in Xingnan.
