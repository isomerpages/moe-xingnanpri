<h3>Badminton&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Xingnanâ€™s Badminton Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) aims to inculcate values
of sportsmanship, discipline and resilience in both our boys and girls
teams. We believe that these values are crucial in preparing our players
in and out of the court. With the shared passion for the sport, we are
persistent in improving our techniques and footwork, constantly striving
for excellence as we learn and grow as individuals and as a team.</p>
<p>Our Badminton CCA is a close-knitted team that encourages one another
in this journey of staying active, building confidence and developing a
lifelong love for the game.</p>
