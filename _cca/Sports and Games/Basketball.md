<h3>Basketball</h3>
<p>Our Basketball Co-Curricular Activity (CCA), proudly known as the Xingnan
Hoopers, offers students an exciting opportunity to build their fitness,
character and confidence through discipline in training and sportsmanship
during play. Players learnt fundamental basketball skills, physical conditioning,
and resilience through various drills.</p>
<p>Through regular training sessions, friendly matches, and inter-school
competitions, students cultivate discipline, perseverance, and resilience.
The CCA also nurtures leadership, communication, and sportsmanship, as
players learn to work closely with their teammates to achieve common goals.</p>
<p>Be it competitive or recreational play, our Basketball CCA is a platform
to grow your confidence, stay active, and develop a lifelong passion for
the game.</p>
